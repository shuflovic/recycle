        <h2>Electronics Recycling: Responsible Disposal Tips</h2>
        <p>Old phones and computers contain valuable materials that can be recovered! Proper e-waste disposal protects the environment and recovers precious metals.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Security First</h3>
        <p>Always wipe personal data before disposal. Use manufacturer reset procedures and consider professional data destruction for sensitive information.</p>
        
        <h3>Donation Opportunities</h3>
        <p>Working devices can benefit schools, community centers, or seniors. Many organizations refurbish electronics for those in need.</p>
        
        <h3>Manufacturer Take-Back Programs</h3>
        <p>Apple, Dell, HP, and other manufacturers offer free recycling programs. They often provide prepaid shipping labels.</p>
        
        <h3>Local E-Waste Events</h3>
        <p>Many communities host periodic e-waste collection drives. Check with your local government or waste management company.</p>
        
        <h3>What Not to Throw Away</h3>
        <p>Never put electronics in regular trash. Batteries, screens, and circuit boards contain materials that require special handling.</p>
